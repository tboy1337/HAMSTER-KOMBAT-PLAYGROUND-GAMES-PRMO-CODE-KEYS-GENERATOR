# HamsterKombat Playground Promo Code Keys Generator

This script is way more advanced than other scripts out there.

- allows generating HamsterKombat coupon code for free using your machine.
- acts as close as possible to real games with delays for game re-installations.
- it doesn't use any proxies, it doesn't make any requests to external APIs.

If you are afraid that your IP will get blocked you can simply use VPN or proxy.

## Important Notice

When new games are out I will need some time to test and update this gist. \
I focus on making this gist as close as possible to real games. \
Be patient. I Usually roll out update after 2PM UTC. \
If you want to use other people insecure scripts with just app token and promo id set - it's up to you. \
Iâ€™m using ios device and android emulator to test games and intercept requests.

> All comments baiting people to use your implementation will be deleted.

## Difference Between Real Games

First and the only difference is Unique Client Id. \
For every request I generate unique client id. \
For every request games re-use same client id. \
I do this to be able to generate many keys without waiting.

## Difference Between Other Generators

1. Sends exactly the same headers as real games.
2. Sends actual events extracted from the games.
3. Uses randomized delays for events.
4. Simulates app reinstall time.

### With Node.js (Windows, Linux, macOS)

Copy `hamster-kombat-playground-games-promo-keys-generator.js` and run it with Node.js.

```shell
node hamster-kombat-playground-games-promo-keys-generator.js
```

### With Node.js One-Liner (Linux, macOS)

```shell
node -e "$(curl -s https://gist.githubusercontent.com/delasy/96c5340fc5e0617ddc1ff4ddb458d968/raw/hamster-kombat-playground-games-promo-keys-generator.js)"
```

### With Python (N/A)

This script is not available in Python :) \
This is JS script that meant to be run with Node.js

## How Long It Takes

### During Weekdays

For one token on average it takes 4m30s. For 6 games and 4 keys - 104 minutes.

### During Weekends

For one token on average it takes 5m. For 6 games and 4 keys - 120 minutes.

## How I Get App Token and Promo Id

I run game on physical device, I actually play the game (so you don't need to). \
While doing this I intercept and inspect requests with Wireshark looking for clues.

## Node.js Version

I personally test on Node.js v18 and v20. On version 16 global fetch is unavailable so this version is not supported.
