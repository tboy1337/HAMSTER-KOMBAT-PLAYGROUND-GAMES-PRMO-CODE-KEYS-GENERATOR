## How To Use

```shell
node hamster-kombat-playground-games-promo-keys-generator.js
```

## How To Setup

Update line with users you want to generate promo codes for:

```js
const users = ['User 1', 'User 2', 'User 3'];

// For example:

const users = ['Aaron', 'Alex'];
```

> These are NOT Telegram usernames. These are just random names to visually differentiate when you are generating keys for multiple people.

If you are generating keys only for yourself, you can leave only one user name like this:

```js
const users = ['Aaron'];
```

That's it.

## How Long It Takes

For one token it takes around 2 minutes. For 4 games and 4 tokens - 32 minutes.
